## User Management API with Advanced Validation and Testing

This repository showcases the development of a feature-rich User Management API designed with robust validation and thorough testing. Built using FastAPI and Pydantic, the project incorporates key features such as secure password validation, token-based authentication, and reliable email handling via SMTP.

# Closed Issues

Below are the closed issues resolved during the project, along with their corresponding links:

# 1.Password Validation Constraints

https://github.com/bb472/repository-name/issues/8

Implemented comprehensive password validation to enforce security standards, including character length and complexity requirements.

# 2. Token Authentication

https://github.com/bb472/repository-name/issues/6

Enhanced JWT-based authentication by introducing:
User roles such as authenticated, admin, and manager.
Validation checks for token format and expiration to improve security.

# 3. User Schema Validation

https://github.com/bb472/repository-name/issues/4

Strengthened validation for user data, ensuring:
Proper formatting of emails and URLs.
At least one field must be modified in PATCH requests.

# 4.SMTP Connection Issue

https://github.com/bb472/repository-name/issues/1

Resolved email notification failures by configuring SMTP credentials securely and implementing retry logic for better reliability.
